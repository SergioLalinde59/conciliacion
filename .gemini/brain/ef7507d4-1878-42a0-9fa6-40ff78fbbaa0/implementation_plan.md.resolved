# Implementation Plan - Atomic Design Refactoring

## Goal
Restructure the `conciliacion.app` frontend to strictly follow Atomic Design principles. This will ensure components are unique, centralized, and scalable, improving both developer experience and user consistency.

## Current State Analysis
- **Atoms**: Partial existence (`Button`, `Input`, `CurrencyDisplay`).
- **Molecules**: Partial existence (`DataTable`, `Modal`, `Filtering`).
- **Uncategorized**: Many feature-specific components (`*Table.tsx`, `*Modal.tsx`) sit in the root of `components`.
- **Missing**: No clear `Templates` layer; Pages often construct layout manually.

## Proposed Structure
We will adopt the following directory structure within `src/components`:

```text
src/
  components/
    atoms/        # Basic logic-less elements (Button, Input, IconWrapper, Badge)
    molecules/    # Small groups of atoms (FormField, SearchInput, PaginationControls)
    organisms/    # Complex sections (Sidebar, DataGrid, FilterPanel, specific Forms like AccountForm)
    templates/    # Page layouts (MainLayout, DashboardLayout, AuthLayout)
  pages/          # Application views connected to state/routes (Dashboard, Configuration)
```

## detailed Migration Plan

### 1. Atoms (The Basics)
Ensure these are generic and styleable.
- `Button`: Standardize variants (primary, secondary, danger, ghost).
- `Input` / `Select` / `Checkbox`: Ensure consistent styling tokens.
- `Typography`: (New) specific components for Headings/Text to enforce font scales.
- `Card`: (New) Base container for panels.

### 2. Molecules (The Building Blocks)
Combinations of atoms that form functional units.
- `FormField`: Label + Input + Error Message.
- `ModalHeader` / `ModalFooter`: Standardize modal parts.
- `FilterGroup`: A grouping of filter selectors.
- `StatCard`: The single summary card used in Dashboard (currently `EstadisticasTotales` might need breaking down).

### 3. Organisms (The Features)
Complex, distinct parts of an interface.
- **Tables**: `CuentasTable`, `MovimientosTable`, etc., should use a generic `DataTable` molecule but live here as specific instances if they have complex logic, or generic `DataGrid` if just props.
    - *Decision*: Refactor all specific tables to be wrappers around a smart `DataTable` molecule/organism.
- **Modals**: `CuentaModal`, `TerceroModal`.
- **Navigation**: `Sidebar`.
- **Global**: `FilterBar` (already in progress/planned).

### 4. Templates (The Layouts)
Abstract structures of pages.
- `MainLayout`: Sidebar + Header + Content Area.
- `TableLayout`: Title + Actions Bar + Filter Area + Table + Pagination.

### 5. Pages (The Instances)
- Refactor logic in [App.tsx](file:///f:/1.%20Cloud/4.%20AI/1.%20Antigravity/ConciliacionWeb/frontend/src/App.tsx) and `src/pages/*` to simply plug data into Templates.

## User Review Required
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Component Movement**: Moving files will require updating imports across the application. I will handle this, but please note that the file history in git for renamed files is usually preserved if done correctly.

> [!NOTE]
> **Design Polish**: As we refactor, I will ensure the "Premium" aesthetic is enforced via the Atoms' CSS.

## Execution Steps
1.  **Approvals**: Confirm this plan.
2.  **Atoms/Molecules Refresh**: Move and polish existing atoms/molecules.
3.  **Organisms Refactor**: Move the big `Table` and `Modal` components into `organisms/`.
4.  **Template Creation**: Create `MainLayout` and `ContentLayout`.
5.  **Page Cleanup**: Update pages to use the new structure.
