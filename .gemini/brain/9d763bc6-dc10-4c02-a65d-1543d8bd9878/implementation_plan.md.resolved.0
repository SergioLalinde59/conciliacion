# Implementation Plan - Fix FondoRenta Extraction Configuration

The investigation revealed that the "FondoRenta" account (ID 3) is missing a specific configuration for extracting movements. It currently falls back to a default extractor (`fondorenta_movimientos`) which expects an older or different specific format ("Traslado..."). The codebase contains a more suitable extractor `fondorenta_extracto_movimientos` which appears to handle the standard extract format (`YYYYMMDD` dates).

## User Review Required
> [!IMPORTANT]
> This change requires the user to **RE-UPLOAD** the extracts for January, February, and April 2025 after the fix is applied. The system cannot re-process the files automatically as they are not stored permanently.

## Proposed Changes

### Database Configuration
#### [INSERT] `cuenta_extractores`
- Insert a new row for `cuenta_id = 3` (FondoRenta), `tipo = 'MOVIMIENTOS'`, `modulo = 'fondorenta_extracto_movimientos'`.
- Ensure `activo = TRUE`.

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- Run [debug_fondo_renta.py](file:///f:/1.%20Cloud/4.%20AI/1.%20Antigravity/ConciliacionWeb/Backend/debug_fondo_renta.py) again to confirm the new configuration is present in `cuenta_extractores`.
- (Optional) If the user provides a sample file path, I could try to run the extractor script directly, but I cannot upload files myself.

### Manual Verification
- User should upload the PDF for April 2025 again.
- Verify in the "Conciliación Mensual" screen that "Movimientos Extracto" now show data and the "Diferencia" decreases or matches the system.
