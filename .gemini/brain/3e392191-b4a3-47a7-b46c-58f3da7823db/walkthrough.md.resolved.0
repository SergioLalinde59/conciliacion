# Walkthrough - Add Discount Stat to Dashboard

I have successfully added the "Total Descuentos" statistic to the Dashboard.

## Changes
### Frontend
- **[App.tsx](file:///f:/1.%20Cloud/4.%20AI/1.%20Antigravity/Facturas/frontend/src/App.tsx)**:
    - Updated [DashboardStats](file:///f:/1.%20Cloud/4.%20AI/1.%20Antigravity/Facturas/frontend/src/App.tsx#63-74) interface to include `total_descuentos`.
    - Added a new [StatCard](file:///f:/1.%20Cloud/4.%20AI/1.%20Antigravity/Facturas/frontend/src/components/organisms/StatCardGrid/StatCardGrid.tsx#13-29) for "Total Descuentos" in the [Dashboard](file:///f:/1.%20Cloud/4.%20AI/1.%20Antigravity/Facturas/frontend/src/App.tsx#63-74) view.
    - Positioned the new card between "Subtotal Acumulado" and "Total IVA".
    - Added a "Ahorro" trend indicator to the card.

## Verification Results

### Manual Verification
