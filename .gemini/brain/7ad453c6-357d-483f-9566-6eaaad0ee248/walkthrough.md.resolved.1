# Multi-Month Reconciliation View

I have updated the "Conciliación Mensual" page to support displaying and editing reconciliation data for a range of months.

## Changes Verified

### Multi-Month Display
- [x] When a date range spanning multiple months is selected (e.g., Nov 2025 - Jan 2026), the system now calculates all months in that range.
- [x] For each visible list account, a separate row is rendered for *each month* in the selected range.
- [x] Each row displays the account name and the specific month/year it corresponds to.

### Data Management
- [x] Data fetching now iterates through all selected months for all selected accounts.
- [x] State keying has been updated to use `${cuentaId}-${year}-${month}` to uniquely identify each row.
- [x] Update, Save, and Recalculate actions now correctly target the specific month row being interacted with.

## Visuals

Users can now see a breakdown like:
- **Ahorros** - *Noviembre 2025*
- **Ahorros** - *Diciembre 2025*
- **Ahorros** - *Enero 2026*

This allows for easier verification of balances over time without switching filters constantly.
