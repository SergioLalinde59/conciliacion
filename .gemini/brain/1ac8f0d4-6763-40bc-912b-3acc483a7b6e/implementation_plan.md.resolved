# Implementation Plan - Fix Vite Startup in [arranque_app.ps1](file:///f:/1.%20Cloud/4.%20AI/1.%20Antigravity/Facturas/arranque_app.ps1)

The goal is to ensure the Vite development server starts correctly when running [arranque_app.ps1](file:///f:/1.%20Cloud/4.%20AI/1.%20Antigravity/Facturas/arranque_app.ps1). Currently, the user reports it is not starting. We will enhance the script to handle dependencies, port conflicts, and ensure visibility.

## User Review Required
> [!NOTE]
> The script will attempt to install `node_modules` if they are missing in the `frontend` directory. This requires `npm` to be installed and available in the system PATH.

## Proposed Changes

### Scripts
#### [MODIFY] [arranque_app.ps1](file:///f:/1.%20Cloud/4.%20AI/1.%20Antigravity/Facturas/arranque_app.ps1)
- Remove any existing `frontend` container to free up port 5174.
- Check if `frontend/node_modules` exists. If not, run `npm install`.
- Update the `Start-Process` command to use `npm run dev` for consistency with `package.json`.
- Add more verbose output to the new PowerShell window to help with debugging (using `cmd /k` or `PowerShell -NoExit` with explicit echo commands).

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
- User runs `.\arranque_app.ps1`.
- User verifies that a new PowerShell window opens for Vite.
- User verifies that `http://localhost:5174` loads the application.
